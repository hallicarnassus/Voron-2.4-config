## My Voron 2.4 350mm Build & Config

This page will document the config and slicer profiles used for a Voron 2.4 350x350x350mm 3D Printer.
The kit was purchased from [Uniqueprints.shop](https://uniqueprints.shop) running on [Klipper firmware](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html).

Currently the printer features the following features:
- Phaetus Dragon all-metal Hotend
- Voron Tap kit, to use the nozzle at the bed probe
- Octopus Pro
- Raspberry Pi 3+
- Stealthburner
- [KUSBA](https://github.com/xbst/KUSBA) input shaper hardware for resonance measurements 
- mini12864 LCD w/neopixel backlighting

I'll upload some of the cabling to the images folder where you can see the contrahelically would main loom from the BTT Octopus to the hotend/extruder assembly and also the wiring that I done for the electronics, I'm a bit of a fan of keeping things neat and tidy and opted for lacing all of the electrical wiring underneath.

The mail slicer I'm currently using is Simplify3D v5.0.1 and will store the profiles here once I've dialled it in.
Other slicers such as SuperSlicer and Cura will eventually make it here but for the meantime I'm pretty happy with the results from S3D.
